A slight tweak to the [Font Awesome 4 Menus plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/font-awesome-4-menus/) updated work with Font Awesome 5.



This is a first cut test to see if the thing even works... documentation just may follow. Below are some mods of the original plugin readme.

## Description

Add Font Awesome 5 icons to your WordPress menus and site without touching a single line of code! With this plugin, just add the full Font Awesome classes, e.g. `fab fa-(icon name)`  as a class/classes to your menu and the plugin will pull that out, put the icon before or after your link text, and wrap your link text in a span so you can show or hide it as you see fit.

In Font Awesome 5 Menus, we have added the ability to add multiple Font Awesome classes for multiple effects (eg, fa-home fa-fw fa-2x will add a fixed-width home icon at two times the normal size).

In addition, we have given you shortcodes to add icons to your posts and pages, as well as shortcodes to take advantage of the new stacked feature of Font Awesome 5 (shortcodes have yet to be tested)

## Installation

Download this repository as a .zip file then upload it as a plugin in your WordPress dashboard. 

Then, activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress. Look for a menu item under the **Settings** menu.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Where can I find all of the available icons? =

Head over to [the Font Awesome website](https://fontawesome.com/icons "the Font Awesome website") to find a full list of icons available. The plugin works with all free icons.

= How to I add an icon to my menu? =

Go to **Appearance** -> **Menus**, select which menu item to which you want to add the icon, and add the icon class(es) under 'CSS Classes (optional)'. (eg, to add the [home icon](https://fontawesome.com/icons/home?style=solid) to your 'Home' link, enter "fas fa-home" (without quotes) as a class. To make it spin, add "fas fa-home fa-spin" as your classes.) Save your menu and voila!

## Updates

5.0 - the very first attempt to get this to work, just tweaked the original plugin slightly.
